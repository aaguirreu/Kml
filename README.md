## Introduction

The precise delimitation of bacterial species and subspecies remains a fundamental challenge in biology and microbiology. Traditional methods based on biological traits often fail to capture the genetic diversity and complexity of microbial life. This project aims to use alignment-free sequence methods to delimit bacterial species and subspecies through the vectorization of DNA sequences based on nucleotide frequencies and machine learning classification methods.

## Abstract

This study aims to use alignment-free sequence methods to delimit bacterial species and subspecies through the vectorization of DNA sequences based on nucleotide frequencies and machine learning classification methods. We utilized the GTDB database Release 09-RS220 to calculate nucleotide frequencies and applied data transformation of sequences to our analysis. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of these methods in accurately distinguishing between different bacterial species and subspecies.

## Installation

Before installing this project, please ensure that you have installed and built [kmertools4ml](https://github.com/aaguirreu/kmertools4ml), as it is used for k-mer counting in this workflow.

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaguirreu/Kml.git
cd Kml
```

### Conda Environment

Set up your Conda environment as follows:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate kml
```

## Usage

Kmer Frequency Counting Command: This command performs k-mer frequency counting using the kmertools4ml utility, which calculates the frequency of subsequences of length k (between 2-10) from the DNA sequences in the specified directory:

```bash
kml -k 2-10 -d path-to-sequences-folder -o output-folder-path
```
Vectorization and Model Evaluation Command: This command performs vectorization of the kmer frequencies and evaluates the data using all available machine learning models:

```bash
kml -k 2-10 -va -ma -d path-to-sequences-folder -o output-folder-path
```

The flags `-va` and `-ma` enable vectorization analysis and model analysis respectively, processing the data through the complete machine learning pipeline.

Specific Model and Vectorization Method: This command uses a specific vectorization method (k-mer) and machine learning model (Random Forest):

```bash
kml -k 2-10 -v kmer -m rf -d path-to-sequences-folder -o output-folder-path
```

Where:
- `-v kmer`: Specifies k-mer vectorization method
- `-m rf`: Uses Random Forest model

## Methods

### Dataset

We used genomes from the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) Release 09-RS220. The genomes were processed to calculate k-mer frequencies, which were then transformed into numerical vectors using the TF-IDF approach. These vectors were used as input for various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

### Implementation

The project is implemented in Python and leverages several key libraries:
- **BioPython** for biological sequence manipulation.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning and vectorization.
- **Matplotlib** for plotting and visualizations.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.

### Key Components

1. **K-mer Frequencies Calculation:** Extract k-mers from DNA sequences and count their occurrences using kmertools4ml.
2. **Vectorization:** Transform k-mer counts into TF-IDF vectors.
3. **Machine Learning Models:** Train and evaluate models to classify DNA sequences.
